                <p>It is based on the 1980 serialized manga of the same name illustrated by Chizuru </br> Takahashi and written by Tetsurō Sayama. Set in 1963 Yokohama, Japan, the film </br> tells the story of Umi Matsuzaki, a high school girl living in her grandmother's </br> boarding house called "Coquelicot Manor". When Umi meets Shun Kazama, </br> a member of the school's newspaper club, they decide to clean up the school's </br> clubhouse, Quartier Latin. However, Tokumaru, the chairman of the local high </br> school and a businessman, intends to demolish the building for redevelopment and </br> Umi and Shun, along with Shirō Mizunuma, must persuade him to reconsider.</p>

                    <p>The coming-of-age story From Up on Poppy Hill, which was directed by Goro Miyazaki (the renowned director Hayao Miyazaki's son), is set in a historical era. The film, which is set just before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, follows a teenage protagonist who must care for her family's boarding house, her two younger brothers, and her academic commitments while her mother is away. There is a compelling romantic plotline (which includes holding hands and declaring love), as well as mystery surrounding a father's adultery, indications of potential incestuous feelings, and the circumstances surrounding the deaths of two men. The teens in the movie are admirable for working together to prevent the demolition of the historic clubhouse at their school. This extremely charming tale, from Up on Poppy Hill, is suitable for readers of all ages. Children might be fascinated by Umi and Shun's friendship, but adults could get more out of the subtle ways that post-war Japan is still coping with the effects of the conflict.</p>

                <p>This acclaimed animated tale by director Hayao Miyazaki follows schoolgirl Satsuke and her </br> younger sister, Mei, as they settle into an old country house with their father and wait for </br> their mother to recover from an illness in an area hospital. As the sisters explore their new home, </br> they encounter and befriend playful spirits in their house and the nearby forest, most notably </br> the massive cuddly creature known as Totoro.</p>

                    <p>Parents need to know that My Neighbor Totoro is a fine pick for the entire family. Although there are slightly creepy "dust sprites" that appear in the house at first, they eventually disappear. Totoro himself might look and sound a bit odd, but he's quite sweet and gentle. The protagonist girls have an ill mother with an unnamed </br> disease, but the moments in the hospital aren't sad or depressing. Some parents may not feel comfortable with the amount of freedom the girls (as is the case with children in all of Hayao Miyazaki's films) have to wander off alone, either around their neighborhood, the surrounding forest, or on a long walk to visit their mother. Overall, this is a family film in the truest sense -- it appeals to moviegoers young and old alike.</p>

                    <p>A Studio Ghibli film, 'Whisper of the Heart' differs from most anime produced by the company in that it is not about cute creatures or other-wordly adventures. Instead, it is a bittersweet tale of a normal teenage girl and the trials of growing up.

                        The film follows Shizuku, a girl in her mid-teens, who lives for her love of books and writing. During her numerous visits to the library, she become aware that all the books she has taken out have been previously checked out by a boy named 'Seiji Amasawa'. It doesn't take long to realise that this Seiji is, in fact, a fellow classmate at her school who she finds infuriatingly arrogant. But as she comes to know him properly, discovering he is a boy with firm ambitions to be a great violin maker, he leaves her yearning to find her own path in life as well as tasting love for the first time.
                        
                        What makes 'Whisper of the Heart' so beautiful is its honest depiction of what it is to be an adolescent on the cusp of adulthood, avoiding pitfalls like descending into sap, depicting teenagers as being perpetually stroppy and difficult or sexing up characters in a vain attempt to make them more appealing to the shallow. We've all been in Shizuku's shoes: feeling the turbulent tugs of first love, floundering over what do to with one's life when it seems everyone else seems to know their own dreams for the future and juggling the turmoils of school life and exams at the same time. Anyone who has ever been fifteen years old will be able to empathise with Shizuku and Seiji and that's what makes them such strong, concrete characters. It also offers an interesting insight into the Japanese culture as we get a close-up look of everyday family and school life in Japan, which in itself is as fascinating as the actual story.
                        
                        'Whisper of the Heart' is much more than just a teenage love story. It's a charming, poignant tale about life and dreams. Another first class film by Studio Ghibli. </p>
