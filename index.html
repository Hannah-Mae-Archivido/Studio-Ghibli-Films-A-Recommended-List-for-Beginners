                <p>It is based on the 1980 serialized manga of the same name illustrated by Chizuru </br> Takahashi and written by Tetsurō Sayama.

                    <p>The coming-of-age story From Up on Poppy Hill, which was directed by Goro Miyazaki (the renowned director Hayao Miyazaki's son), is set in a historical era. The film, which is set just before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, follows a teenage protagonist who must care for her family's boarding house, her two younger brothers, and her academic commitments while her mother is away. There is a compelling romantic plotline (which includes holding hands and declaring love), as well as mystery surrounding a father's adultery, indications of potential incestuous feelings, and the circumstances surrounding the deaths of two men. The teens in the movie are admirable for working together to prevent the demolition of the historic clubhouse at their school. This extremely charming tale, from Up on Poppy Hill, is suitable for readers of all ages. Children might be fascinated by Umi and Shun's friendship, but adults could get more out of the subtle ways that post-war Japan is still coping with the effects of the conflict.</p>

                <p>This acclaimed animated tale by director Hayao Miyazaki follows schoolgirl Satsuke and her </br> younger sister, Mei, as they settle into an old country house with their father and wait for </br> their mother to recover from an illness in an area hospital. As the sisters explore their new home, </br> they encounter and befriend playful spirits in their house and the nearby forest, most notably </br> the massive cuddly creature known as Totoro.</p>

                    <p>Parents need to know that My Neighbor Totoro is a fine pick for the entire family. Although there are slightly creepy "dust sprites" that appear in the house at first, they eventually disappear. Totoro himself might look and sound a bit odd, but he's quite sweet and gentle. The protagonist girls have an ill mother with an unnamed disease, but the moments in the hospital aren't sad or depressing. Some parents may not feel comfortable with the amount of freedom the girls (as is the case with children in all of Hayao Miyazaki's films) have to wander off alone, either around their neighborhood, the surrounding forest, or on a long walk to visit their mother. Overall, this is a family film in the truest sense -- it appeals to moviegoers young and old alike.</p>

                    <p>A Studio Ghibli film, 'Whisper of the Heart' differs from most anime produced by the company in that it is not about cute creatures or other-wordly adventures. Instead, it is a bittersweet tale of a normal teenage girl and the trials of growing up.

                        The film follows Shizuku, a girl in her mid-teens, who lives for her love of books and writing. During her numerous visits to the library, she become aware that all the books she has taken out have been previously checked out by a boy named 'Seiji Amasawa'. It doesn't take long to realise that this Seiji is, in fact, a fellow classmate at her school who she finds infuriatingly arrogant. But as she comes to know him properly, discovering he is a boy with firm ambitions to be a great violin maker, he leaves her yearning to find her own path in life as well as tasting love for the first time.
                        
                        What makes 'Whisper of the Heart' so beautiful is its honest depiction of what it is to be an adolescent on the cusp of adulthood, avoiding pitfalls like descending into sap, depicting teenagers as being perpetually stroppy and difficult or sexing up characters in a vain attempt to make them more appealing to the shallow. We've all been in Shizuku's shoes: feeling the turbulent tugs of first love, floundering over what do to with one's life when it seems everyone else seems to know their own dreams for the future and juggling the turmoils of school life and exams at the same time. Anyone who has ever been fifteen years old will be able to empathise with Shizuku and Seiji and that's what makes them such strong, concrete characters. It also offers an interesting insight into the Japanese culture as we get a close-up look of everyday family and school life in Japan, which in itself is as fascinating as the actual story.
                        
                        'Whisper of the Heart' is much more than just a teenage love story. It's a charming, poignant tale about life and dreams. Another first class film by Studio Ghibli. </p>

                    <p>Alovable 1989 anime from Japanese master Hayao Miyazaki, part of the Studio Ghibli Forever season. Like his classic My Neighbour Totoro, this seamlessly works elements of fantasy and mild crises into an everyday children’s story, though this one serves more as a primer for womanhood. Kiki is a young witch a profession that carries no sinister associations. Having reached the age of 13, tradition dictates that she must fly the nest on a sort of witchy gap year. Accompanied by her sardonic cat Jiji, and with a shaky grip of broomstick aviation, she winds up lodging with a kindly baker, for whom she begins an airborne delivery service.
                     The plot is so loose as to barely exist, but beneath its sunny, colour-saturated, beautifully animated surface, the film becomes a benign guided tour of femininity (there’s barely a male character in the film), gently broaching universal coming-of-age issues such as independence, insecurity, and even more boldly than any Western children’s movie would contemplate  sexuality.</p>

                    <p>As it is in most of the best fairy-tales that have been read to us as children, Howl’s Moving Castle involves a curse, a strong female protagonist, a villain, a charming wizard, badass side characters and the most fascinating element of the movie: the moving Castle. The Castle is actually a character itself in its cluttered, mismatched Steampunk-meets-Harry Potter-style, and we are introduced to it at the very beginning in a wonderful establishing shot, where the Castle is coming through from a dense cloaking fog hopping on its two chicken legs. This opening frame is Miyazaki’s most used opening shot. It has been in many other Studio Ghibli movies, most notably in Nausicaa in the Valley of the Wind (1984) and Laputa – Castle in the Sky (1986), where we follow a foreign, almost alien object appearing from a distance on a natural setting (nature is always an essential silent character in all Studio Ghibli’s movies). Howl’s Moving Castle is definitely one of Miyazaki’s most complex and layered creations, where the coming-of-age theme actually has adult and complex tones. This grown-up adventure is heavily interwoven with anti-war feelings, openly shared by Miyazaki himself – the talented director has been relentlessly threading pacifist messages in his movies since the beginning of his career, and this one is no exception.
                        It is clear that overcoming fears, identity and self-worth are pivotal elements in all Studio Ghibli movies, as well as recurrent motifs of compassion, love, sacrifice and self-discovery; this makes Howl’s Moving Castle not only a wonderfully timeless movie, but an ageless one too.</p>

                <div class="descriptionmononoke">
                    <p>This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war. The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards. The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance. But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance. The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy. The story is not easy to understand. It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.

                        The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore. And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.
                        
                        The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted. Japanese television documented a lot of the production. The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have "gotten it" quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.
                        
                        If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work). Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that. His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute. There is no other animation like it. This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.</p>

            <div class="descripwind">
                <p>The Wind Rises (風立ちぬ Kaze Tachinu) is the 19th animated film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli for the Nippon Television Network, Dentsu, Hakuhodo DY Media Partners, Walt Disney Japan, Mitsubishi, Toho and KDDI and distributed by Toho. It was released on July 20, 2013, in Japan and February 21, 2014, in America.

                    It is based on the serialized manga of the same name, written and illustrated by Miyazaki on Model Graphix magazine and Tatsuo Hori's acclaimed 1937 novel The Wind Has Risen. It traces the life of Jirô Horikoshi, an aircraft engineer who invented the famous "Zero" fighter, which was used by the Japanese navy during World War II. The film and the manga also chronicles the life of Jiro's wife, Naoko, a fictional character from Hori's original novel. The story describes the tragic fate of the young couple in the maelstrom of prewar Japan, and depicts Taishô and Shôwa Japan from the economic hardships in the 1920s through the rise of militarism in the 1930s.[5]
                    
                    The film's theatrical poster contains the dedication, "In honor of Jirô Horikoshi and Tatsuo Hori.".</p>

                <div class="descriptionwind">
                    <p>This is a breathtaking masterpiece of art that allows your mind and heart to soar like the wind .The story is loosely based on the real life story of Jiro Horikoshi (Joseph Gordon- Levitt). He dreams of flying but, because he's nearsighted, decides to be a Japanese airplane designer. We observe his life from child to adulthood as he makes his dream plane and, in the process, falls in love with Naoko (Emily Blunt). Will Jiro create the beautiful plane or realize that the beauty he's seeking is right in front of him all along?

                        The film is a work of art. Hayao Miyazaki (Director and Writer) creates unique color palettes and designs. Since the movie takes place in the sky, the animators go above and beyond to hand draw backgrounds and movements for the planes. We witness them majestically soaring through the skies and you feel as if you're with them. The voice acting is well done. I think they portrayed the characters and their relationships exceptionally well. Much of the film focuses on the romance between Naoko and Jiro. Their connection is both loving and tragic. The film was first released in Japan, so American voice-overs are dubbed over the animation and yes, it can be distracting. They confront actual events that happened in Japan, such as the Kanto earth-quake of 1923 and Japan entering the war. I love the truth in this film. It doesn't shy away from talking about the real issues that happened during this time.
                        
                        My favorite character is Mr.Caproni (Stanley Tucci) a historical Italian aircraft designer who is Jiro's mentor in his dreams. I enjoy Stanley's voice acting skills. He's one of those character actors who is fantastic at everything he does. The character himself is fascinating. He looks at aircraft not as a bringer of war, but a creator of dreams.
                        
                        My favorite scene is the last dream sequence, after Jiro goes through a life changing experience. This is one of those bitter sweet endings, where you don't know what to think at first. You just need to take it all in.
                        
                        The message in this film is, "Sometimes the outcome to your dream is not always what you expect." Jiro spends his whole life wanting to make his aircraft, determined to do anything to fulfill his goal. After a few sacrifices, he realizes his potential but it's not what he expects. Mr. Caproni then asks him, "Did you have a good ten years?"</p>
